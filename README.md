# AstoShop Dashboard

A fast, responsive, and reusable e-commerce admin dashboard built with Astro and TypeScript. AstoShop provides a clear overview of store revenue, orders, customers, products, inventory, acquisition channels, and conversion performance.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is under active development. The e-commerce foundation, core UI components, analytics, and primary business views are available. Data mutations and backend integrations are planned for future releases.

## Overview

AstoShop is designed as a practical foundation for online store back offices. It helps store managers:

- monitor revenue, orders, average order value, and conversion rate;
- analyze acquisition channels and sales trends;
- review orders, payments, and fulfillment statuses;
- track products, categories, pricing, and inventory;
- understand customer activity and lifetime spending;
- monitor store notifications and low-stock alerts.

The dashboard currently uses typed local mock data. This keeps the interface independent from any backend and makes it easy to connect an API, CMS, or commerce platform later.

## Features

- E-commerce overview with key performance indicators
- Revenue and conversion charts built with lightweight SVG and CSS
- Interactive acquisition chart powered by Apache ECharts and loaded on demand
- Responsive sidebar and mobile navigation
- Product catalog with pricing and inventory status
- Order tracking with payment and fulfillment information
- Customer overview with order count and total spending
- Store notifications and account settings
- Reusable, typed, and accessible Astro components
- Fast static output with minimal client-side JavaScript

## Pages

| Route | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Store performance overview and recent activity |
| `/analytics` | Revenue, acquisition channels, and conversion trends |
| `/products` | Product catalog, prices, categories, and inventory |
| `/orders` | Orders, payments, and fulfillment statuses |
| `/customers` | Customer activity, orders, and total spending |
| `/notifications` | Store alerts and recent events |

Legacy routes for projects, tasks, and users redirect to their corresponding e-commerce pages.
